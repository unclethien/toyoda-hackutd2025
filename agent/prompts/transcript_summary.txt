You are given the transcript of a call from a car purchase advisor to a car dealership.

The goal of the advisor is to confirm the availability and ask for extra information about a car reportedly listed at the dealer. So based on the conversation's transcript, extract the key information and put in a JSON file as follows:
{
    "is_available": bool, # whether the car is still available
    "deal_price": int, # what is the actual listed price of the car
    "remarks": str, # further remarks about the car by the dealer
}
